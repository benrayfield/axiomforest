# axiomforest
A 3 way forest where all paths lead to leaf where turing complete axioms can be built which are bigO(1) to eval, and a layer of 3-way forest above that with true or false at each node, as an infinite dimensional sparse bloom filter where each node may be true, false, or unknown and never observed especially if unproveable. This will be a layer under wikibinator, which is a universal lambda function (combinator) and pattern calculus function, which forks of wikibinator or other systems could use to share the same 3-way forest and provide third party validation of the claim that wikibinator is just an axiom in the axiom space and is not above or below any other possible axioms.
