/** UPDATE: 2-way forest instead of 3-way, cuz I thought of a way
to put the bloom filter inside the 6 param wikibinator function,
so any other systems can still go in the same bloomfilter.
Will still sometimes include 3 childs (instead of 4) cuz of including superposition()
which is a cache and superposition().allUnknown() is true. superposition() can be derived from binary forest.

Unknown is the default answer for every question,
which may become yes or no but if it becomes both at once
(2 different paths of figuring things out, one leads to yes and one leads to no),
it is therefore proven that something in that process is bull.
Anything derived from bull is bull, like a "loaded question"
is a bull statement followed by a question whose answer
does not depend on that statement, so in that case any answer
to the "loaded question" implies the bull statement is non-bull,
therefore the set of those things is bull even if not everything in the set is bull.
<br><br>
If you want more digits of precision than just these 2 bits,
such as OpenCOG's TruthValue has 2 fractions of CHANCE and CERTAINTY... Dont do that,
but use 2 numbers that are CertaintyOfYes and CertaintyOfNo,
where CertaintyOfYes+CertaintyOfNo<=1 and each are in range 0 to 1,
and BULL happens when their sum > 1,
or beyond that you could use Bayes Rule andOr other statistics on combos of many possible statements,
but I'm guessing that the Verse datastruct will handle that most efficiently,
maybe with a little neuralnets, bayesnets, and other optimizations used where they help.
