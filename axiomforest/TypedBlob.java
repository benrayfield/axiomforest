axiomforest.Î» knows if its a bitstring and its size, but anything more complex than that
needs to go in how various systems use axiomforest.
((u u) u) is 1. (u (u u)) is 0.

Rewrite this disorganized text[
FIXME if this is part of axiomforest, where ((u u) u) is 1 and (u (u u)) is 0,
	then it cant put in the extra bits of "boolean flo" and "byte piz" (such as float is a 1<<5 bit flo and piz is 5).
	Axiomforest can know something is or is not a bitstring and its length, and thats it.
	Also, axiomforest supports unlimited size bitstrings, so there needs to be a way to say
	that even though the interface only has longs and is bit aligned, that its bigger.
	Axiomforest's header knows log2 of bitstring size up to about cbt size 2^124 bits,
	but it also has a way to say its either bigger or not a bitstring.
